unpack all the files in the foler into a single folder. 

1) The equations for recursive and non recursive calculation of the synchrophasor are provided 
in the "phasor_calculation_recursive.m" & in "phasor_calculation_non_recursive.m" respectively


2) Then run the 'phasor_gui.m'. The GUI should start.

3) enter the nominal frequency, frequency , amplitude and phase angle of the sinusoid and click "calculate phasor" button

the different graphs should show the values and the difference in the calculation in recursive and non recursive method.
4)check the check box to enable the three point averaging algorithm for off-nominal conditions
